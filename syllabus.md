## About üßê

The last decade has seen an explosion in the size and complexity of datasets. Many popular data analysis software packages: R, Matlab, SPSS, etc. are not adequate when the data size is many times the memory size. New packages such as Spark and Tensorflow have been developed that process massive data using commodity computers in the cloud.

In this class you will learn the statistical and engineering foundations of big data Analytics.

## Prerequisites

This class has four pre-requisites (Some of these pre-requisites will be tested in the quizzes):

- **Linear Algebra:** Vector spaces, general bases and orthonormal bases, orthonormal transformations, eigen-vectors and eigen-values, and matrix notations.
- **Probability and Statistics:** Random Variables, Expectation, Standard Deviation, PCA, linear regression, t-tests.
- **Unix:** Navigating and changing the file hierarchy, paths, environmental variables, ssh, mount, pip install, conda install.
- **Python programming:** Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter notebooks.

## Curriculum

- **Engineering Big Data:**

  - I/O limited computation and the memory bottleneck.
  - Data parallel computation in the cloud.
  - Map-reduce, NFS, Spark
  - DataFrames and SQL in Spark.

- **Analyzing Big Data:**

  - Unsupervised learning: PCA
  - Analysis of NOAA historical weather data using PCA
  - Visualizing and Understanding PCA eigen-decomposition
  - Mapping weather information using `iPyLeaflet`

- **Classification:**

  - Decision trees, Bagging, and Random Forests
  - Boosting

- **Machine Learning Paradigms:**

  - RMS Methodology
  - The strange behavious of high dimensional data
  - Generative vs. Discriminative Learning
  - Learning by Elimination

- **Quantifying Stability and over-fitting:**
  - k-fold cross validation

## Final Project

- **Competition:**
  - The challange is to estimate the relative wealth of different areas in africa from sattelite images. [Wilds/Poverty](https://wilds.stanford.edu/datasets/#povertymap)
  - Starter solutions using (1) boosting+KDtree color coding, (2) Neural Networks, will be given and explained
  - The final score would be based on multiple loss functions, representing different confidence levels

---

## Grading

- **HW:** There will be 5 graded HWs (including the final project). The HW will be in the form of Jupyter Notebooks / NBGrader assignments.
- **Quizes:** There will be a quiz on the first class of each week. Quizes will be answered on paper at the start of class and manually graded. Some quizes will be filled online.
- **Final:** A final 2 hour exam (3 hour for students that need 50% additional time) will take place in person at the end of the quarter.
- **Final Grade** will be HW(40%) + Quizes(30%) + Final(30%)
- **Grading scale**
  - A+ (100)
  - A (95-99)
  - A- (90-94)
  - B+ (87-89)
  - B (83-86)
  - B- (80-82)
  - C+ (77-79)
  - C (73-76)
  - C- (70-72)

The quiz/HW grades that will be assigned to students that join the course late will be the median of the grade assigned to submitted quizes / assignments.
