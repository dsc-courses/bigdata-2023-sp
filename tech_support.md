## Accessing Notebooks on DataHub


By this point everybody registered for the course should have a Datahub container for the course available and ready on datahub.ucsd.edu.

In the public folder, you will be able to locate a folder "Lectures Notebooks Spring 2023" which contains all the notebooks, however this is a "Read-Only" version of the notebooks, so you would have to copy these into your private directory for you to be able to make modifications/experiment with the notebook and save your work.

In order to copy them into private, simply
1. click on "New" over on top right corner.
2. Open New Terminal
3. Type in prompt: $ cp -r public/Lectures\ Notebooks\ Spring\ 2023 private/

Now you have all the notebooks available in your private directory for you to directly start working on.
